shespelt forked this project from jdimond's countdown-timer on Dec 27, 2014 to add chromecast capability.

my current idea is to use a custom receiver to take commands from the app via the messge bus. 
Let the javascript in the receiver page do all the client work (via js setInterval() callbacks ) to update the page rendered on the chromecast display.
